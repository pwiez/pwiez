ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pwiez, 24yo from Brazil!
My current programming interests are learning Python, RoR, web development and SQL.

I'm currently an undergrad in Systems Analysis and Development at PUCPR.
I'm also a Psychology undergrad at UFPR. I find it immensely gratifying to learn about the science of behavior analysis.
