ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pwiez, 24yo from Brazil!
My current programming interests are learning Python, Ruby and web development.

I'm currently an undergrad in Systems Analysis and Development at PUCPR.
I'm also a Psychology undergrad at UFPR, close to finishing the course. 
I find it immensely gratifying to learn about the science of behavior analysis (Skinner rules).
